# Workshop 4

By: Owen Wurtele

## Emphasis

Consistently recognized as one of *Canada’s top universities*, Trent University is home to a _dynamic community_ of scholars embodying our motto nunc cognosco ex parte – now I know in part – valuing what has been learned, and what is yet to be discovered.

## Strong

Attracting **excellent** students from across the country and around the world, Trent is known for leadership in teaching, research, and student __satisfaction__. Here, students connect and collaborate with faculty, staff, and their peers through diverse communities that span our unique collegiate communities, disciplines, hands-on research, co-op and career experience, and community-based activities.
